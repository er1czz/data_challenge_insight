Insight Data Challenge Practices (20C.DS.SV)

## Key Component of a good data challenge submission
1. EDA  (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
2. MVP (Minimium Viable Product)  
3. Level Up (additional features, tuning hyperparameters)   
4. Communication (code easy to read, well-written markdown, organized structure)

## Challenge 1 Breast Cancer Cell Detection
**Please limit yourself to 1.5 hours time!**  
 
*You belong to the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with 
developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data 
about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).*   
1. What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy? 
2. How would a physician use your product? 
3. There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of 
detecting malignancy? 


Your task is to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell.  

Even though this seems like a fairly straightforward task, there are so many ways you can explore, visualize, engineer your features, and tell a story with this data. It will be interesting to see the different approaches people take! Some important questions to think about are: how can you best explore the data? Why did you select your particular model? How did you validate your model? What insights can you derive from your results?

Follow data challenge best practices. Pay particular attention to how you present your findings - communicate your critical thinking, tell a data story. Please code and annotate your analysis in a Jupyter notebook. Please place your submission in the submission folder.

The dataset consists of 699 cells for which you have the following features:
Sample code number: id number Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 Mitoses: 1 - 10 Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
